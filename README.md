# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning  

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a machine learning approach to detect fraudulent activities. The project focuses on analyzing patterns in financial transactions and building a model to identify potential fraud.  

## Project Overview  

Fraud detection is a critical problem in many industries, especially finance and e-commerce. This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a classification model capable of distinguishing between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.  

The dataset and methods used are designed to explore key concepts such as feature engineering, model evaluation, and interpretability in fraud detection.  

## Features  

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and creating features that improve model performance.
- **Modeling**: Training and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Using precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC to assess performance.
- **Visualization**: Exploring data insights and results through visual tools.

## Notebook Content  

The notebook includes the following steps:  

1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset for analysis.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data distribution and identifying patterns.  
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.  
4. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.  
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the models using appropriate metrics and selecting the best-performing one.  
6. **Fraud Detection Insights**: Interpreting the results and understanding the key factors influencing fraud detection.

## Technologies Used

    Python
    Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
    Scikit-learn for machine learning
    Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

## Used Techniques Overview

* __Isolation Forest:__ An unsupervised anomaly detection method that isolates outliers in the data by randomly selecting features and splitting the data.

* __DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):__ A clustering algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed while marking points in low-density regions as outliers.

* __SVM (Support Vector Machines):__ A supervised learning method effective for binary classification tasks, often used with kernel tricks to handle non-linear data.

* __PCA (Principal Component Analysis):__ A dimensionality reduction technique that projects data onto the directions of maximum variance to simplify analysis while preserving key information.

* __t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):__ A non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm optimized for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.

* __UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection):__ A fast and flexible dimensionality reduction method that preserves local and global data structure better than t-SNE in many cases.

## Results

The final model achieves a high precision and recall, making it effective at identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
Future Work
